# Clean Architecture Summary

You're absolutely right! Here's the clean separation:

## What Actually Needs the OpenAI API Key

**ONLY the Hook Generation feature** in the Products tab uses OpenAI.

## What Doesn't Need the API Key

- ✅ Video Rendering (uses Remotion, not AI)
- ✅ Carousel Creation
- ✅ GIF/Meme Generation  
- ✅ File uploads
- ✅ Everything else

## The Clean Architecture

### 1. For AI Hook Generation (Products Tab)
```
Frontend → Vercel Function (/api/generate-hooks) → OpenAI
           (API key secure on server)
```

### 2. For Video Rendering
```
Frontend → Backend Server (/render-video) → Remotion
           (No API key needed!)
```

## Why This Makes Sense

1. **Video rendering** is just processing - it takes your video files and text, then uses Remotion to create the final video. No AI involved!

2. **Only Hook Generation** uses AI (OpenAI GPT-4) to create viral hooks based on your product info.

## Summary

- **OpenAI API Key**: Only needed for generating AI hooks
- **Video Rendering**: Completely separate, no API key required
- **Backend Server**: Still needed for Remotion video processing, but doesn't touch OpenAI

This is actually a much cleaner architecture - each service does one thing well!
