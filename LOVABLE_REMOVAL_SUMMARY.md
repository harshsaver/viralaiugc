# Lovable References Removed

## Summary

All references to Lovable have been successfully removed from the project.

## Changes Made:

### 1. `frontend/vite.config.ts`
- Removed import: `import { componentTagger } from "lovable-tagger";`
- Removed plugin usage: `componentTagger()` from plugins array
- Simplified plugins array - no longer needs `.filter(Boolean)`

### 2. `frontend/package.json`
- Removed dependency: `"lovable-tagger": "^1.1.7"` from devDependencies

### 3. `README.md`
- Removed: "Frontend and DB are completely vibe-coded with Lovable."
- Cleaned up text formatting

### 4. `frontend/package-lock.json`
- Automatically updated by running `npm install`
- Removed all lovable-tagger related entries (9 packages total)

## Result

The project is now completely free of Lovable dependencies and references. The application will function exactly the same, just without the Lovable development tooling that was only used in development mode.
