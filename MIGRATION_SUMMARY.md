- ✅ GifsDisplay now uses 'gif' video_type instead of 'meme'

## Required Actions

### 1. Run Database Migration
Execute the `sql_migration.sql` file in your Supabase SQL editor to:
- Add 'gif' to the video_type enum
- Update all RLS policies to work without authentication

### 2. Install Dependencies (if needed)
```bash
cd frontend && npm install
cd ../backend && npm install
```

### 3. Update Environment Variables
No changes needed to environment variables.

### 4. Test the Application
1. Start the backend server: `cd backend && npm start`
2. Start the frontend: `cd frontend && npm run dev`
3. Test gif creation with green screen removal
4. Verify all features work without authentication

## Known Issues & Limitations

### 1. TypeScript Errors
Some TypeScript errors remain due to missing type declarations. These don't affect functionality but should be addressed:
- useState type parameters in some components
- Missing ReactNode type imports

### 2. Green Screen Limitations
- Current implementation uses CSS mix-blend-mode for basic green screen effect
- For better results, consider implementing proper chroma key in Remotion using canvas manipulation
- Sensitivity threshold is fixed at 100 - could be made adjustable

### 3. Storage Considerations
- All uploads now work without authentication
- Consider implementing rate limiting or file size restrictions for public uploads

## Future Enhancements

1. **Improved Green Screen**: Implement more sophisticated chroma key algorithm with adjustable sensitivity
2. **Video Export**: Add download functionality for generated videos
3. **Templates**: Add more gif templates with green screen
4. **Performance**: Optimize canvas rendering for smoother preview
5. **UI Polish**: Add loading states and better error handling
