# Mobile Warning Fix Summary

## Issue
The mobile warning modal was appearing on ALL pages, including the landing page, preventing mobile users from accessing the waitlist signup.

## Solution
Updated the `MobileWarningWrapper` component in `App.tsx` to check the current route and only show the mobile warning on dashboard routes.

### Changes Made:
```javascript
// Only show mobile warning on dashboard routes, not on landing page
const shouldShowMobileWarning = location.pathname.startsWith('/dashboard');

return shouldShowMobileWarning ? <MobileWarningModal /> : null;
```

## Result
- **Landing page (`/`)**: Works perfectly on mobile with `bg2.png` background, no warning
- **Dashboard (`/dashboard`)**: Shows mobile warning as intended (since it's not optimized for mobile)
- **Other pages**: No mobile warning

## Mobile Experience:
- Landing page is fully responsive
- Shows `bg2.png` on mobile devices
- Shows `bg1.png` on desktop devices
- Waitlist form works on all screen sizes

The landing page now provides a seamless experience for mobile users to join the waitlist!
